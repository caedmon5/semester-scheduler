# 📁 data/

This folder is for **generated `.ics` calendar files**.

You can use it to store:

- `summer_schedule.ics`
- `fall_schedule.ics`
- `personal_schedule.ics`

These files are **not tracked** by Git to protect your personal information and avoid version noise.

This folder is mirrored conceptually by `schedules/private/`, which stores schedule sources.
